# Day 6 — Frontend (Mobile App) Integration Prompt (Send this to Claude)

**PROMPT TO CLAUDE (Day 6):**

> "Today, connect the UI with the backend.
>
> **Tasks:**
> 1. Implement all Figma screens as a mobile UI (e.g., using React Native, Flutter, or a cross‑platform framework of your choice).
> 2. Add navigation between screens (splash → onboarding → login → home → other pages).
> 3. Connect the search bar to the `/search` backend endpoint.
> 4. Connect the voice‑search button/pop‑up to the `/voice-search` endpoint.
> 5. Display search results in a scrollable list with product images, names, vendor info, and relevance scores.
> 6. Render the market map with vendor pins using a map component (e.g., Mapbox, Google Maps SDK).
> 7. Draw the navigation route line on the map based on the `/navigate` endpoint response.
> 8. Add loading spinners, error handling, and toast notifications for API calls.
> 9. Ensure the app is responsive, follows the Neumorphic design system defined in Day 1, and works on both iOS and Android devices.
>
> **Deliverable:** A step‑by‑step implementation guide (Markdown) covering UI component structure, navigation setup, API integration code snippets, and testing instructions (manual UI testing and optional automated UI tests).
